Edit this readme.md file to answer the following questions:

### Busy-waiting vs. Condition Variables

Once you have condition variables working in your program, compare the performance of busy waiting with condition variables. To ensure a fair comparison, use a single thread.

Report for the original program as well as modified version:

1. Total program run time
2. Hashes per second
3. CPU usage during execution (use the `top` command to get a rough estimate of the average CPU usage)

Argument: 

Condition Variables:

1. Total run time: 1.85s
2. Hashes per second: 547563.49
3. CPU usage:

Busy Waiting:

1. Total run time:
2. Hashes per second:
3. CPU usage:

Which version performs better? Is this the result you expected? Why or why not?

### Nonces Per Task

Experiment with different values for `NONCES_PER_TASK`. What value yields the best performance in terms of hashes per second on your machine?

120 seems to be the best NONCES_PER_TASK for the best results.

### Performance I

When evaluating parallel programs, we use speedup and efficiency. Why are these metrics not as useful when measuring the performance of our parallel crytocurrency miner?


### Performance II

Using any of the `kudlick` machines (in our 220 classroom), what is the highest performance you were able to achieve in terms of hashes per second? What configuration did you use (`NONCES_PER_TASK`, number of threads, block data, compiler options)?
